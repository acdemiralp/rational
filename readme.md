### Rational
Implementation of the (not yet written) std::experimental::rational proposal.

### Getting started
- Copy `include/std/experimental/rational.hpp` to your project.
- See `tests/rational_test.cpp` for usage.

### Acknowledgements
- The library is inspired by:
  - [std::complex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex)
  - [boost::rational](https://github.com/boostorg/rational)
  - [rational.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/rational.jl)
- The existence of [boost::rational](https://github.com/boostorg/rational) was unknown during initial development.
